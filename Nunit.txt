Nunit is a unit testing framework for all .Net languages.Initially ported from Junit.
It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities.

1-writing test method using Nunit.
Created three separate methods for Initialising, Executing a test(can have many tests) and Clean up method.
 class Program
    {
       
        //create reference for the browser and set it as a global variable
        IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            
        }

        [SetUp]
        public void Initialize()
        {
            //navigate to Google Page
            driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://www.google.com");

            //maximize window
            driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();

            Console.WriteLine("Opened URL");

        }

        [Test]
        public void ExecuteTest()
        {
            //Find the search text Box element
            IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.Name("q"));

            //perform ops by sending value to the text box
            element.SendKeys("execute automation");

            Console.WriteLine("Executed Test");

        }

        [Test]
        public void NextTest()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Executing next Test method");
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void CleanUp()
        {
            //close window
            driver.Close();

            Console.WriteLine("Closed the browser");

        }
    }
}


2-Creating custom methods for Selenium.
Creating custom method of controls to \\set\\ values into the control like Text box, Drop Down box, Check box etc.

Part-1
Instead of looking for an element in DOM(web Page) through Selenium WebDriver.Find Element method we will create a custom method in a separate class called SeleniumSetMethods.cs.
Example:EnterText(element,value,type)

Part-2
Create Custom methods of controls to \\Get\\ the values into the control like Text Box, Drop down box and Check box etc.
